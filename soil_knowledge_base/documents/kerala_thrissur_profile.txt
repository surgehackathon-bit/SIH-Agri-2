City: Thrissur
Coordinates: 10.5276°N, 76.2144°E
Analysis Area: 10 km radius around city center
Data Source: SoilGrids 2.0 (ISRIC World Soil Information)

SOIL CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------
Soil pH:
  Value: 54.40 pH units
  Description: pH measured in water solution
  Agricultural Significance: Controls nutrient availability, microbial activity, and crop selection
  Interpretation: Alkaline (pH 54.4) - may need soil amendments

Soil Organic Carbon:
  Value: 412.41 g/kg
  Description: Organic carbon content in soil
  Agricultural Significance: Key indicator of soil health, fertility, and carbon storage
  Interpretation: High organic carbon (41.2%) - excellent soil health

Clay Content:
  Value: 306.08 %
  Description: Proportion of clay particles < 0.002mm
  Agricultural Significance: Affects water retention, nutrient availability, and soil structure
  Interpretation: Clay-dominated soil (306%) - high fertility but may have drainage issues


AGRICULTURAL ASSESSMENT
----------------------

Soil Limitations:
  • Alkaline soil may cause nutrient deficiencies

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------
• Add sulfur or organic acids to lower pH from 54.4 to neutral range
• Improve drainage through raised beds or subsurface drainage systems
• Avoid field operations when soil is wet to prevent compaction

TECHNICAL NOTES
--------------
• Data extracted from global 250m resolution SoilGrids database
• Analysis focused on topsoil layer (0-5cm depth)
• Values represent spatial averages within the analysis area
• Recommendations are general guidelines - consult local experts for specific advice

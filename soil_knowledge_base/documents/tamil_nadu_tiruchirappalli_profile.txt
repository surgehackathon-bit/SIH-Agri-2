============================================================

LOCATION INFORMATION
-------------------
City: Tiruchirappalli
Coordinates: 10.7905°N, 78.7047°E
Analysis Area: 10 km radius around city center
Data Source: SoilGrids 2.0 (ISRIC World Soil Information)

SOIL CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------
Soil pH:
  Value: 73.94 pH units
  Description: pH measured in water solution
  Agricultural Significance: Controls nutrient availability, microbial activity, and crop selection
  Interpretation: Alkaline (pH 73.9) - may need soil amendments

Soil Organic Carbon:
  Value: 307.91 g/kg
  Description: Organic carbon content in soil
  Agricultural Significance: Key indicator of soil health, fertility, and carbon storage
  Interpretation: High organic carbon (30.8%) - excellent soil health

Clay Content:
  Value: 358.64 %
  Description: Proportion of clay particles < 0.002mm
  Agricultural Significance: Affects water retention, nutrient availability, and soil structure
  Interpretation: Clay-dominated soil (359%) - high fertility but may have drainage issues

Sand Content:
  Value: 366.96 %
  Description: Proportion of sand particles 0.05-2mm
  Agricultural Significance: Affects drainage, aeration, and soil workability
  Interpretation: Value: 366.96 %

Silt Content:
  Value: 274.41 %
  Description: Proportion of silt particles 0.002-0.05mm
  Agricultural Significance: Influences water retention and provides balanced soil properties
  Interpretation: Value: 274.41 %

Cation Exchange Capacity:
  Value: 311.49 cmol(c)/kg
  Description: Soil nutrient holding capacity
  Agricultural Significance: Higher values indicate better nutrient retention and soil fertility
  Interpretation: High nutrient holding capacity (311.5 cmol/kg) - excellent for agriculture

Bulk Density:
  Value: 144.74 kg/dm³
  Description: Bulk density of fine earth fraction
  Agricultural Significance: Indicates soil compaction, affects water infiltration and root growth
  Interpretation: Value: 144.74 kg/dm³


AGRICULTURAL ASSESSMENT
----------------------
Highly Suitable Crops:
  • Sugarcane
  • Rice

Soil Limitations:
  • Alkaline soil may cause nutrient deficiencies
  • Heavy clay soil - drainage may be poor

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------
• Add sulfur or organic acids to lower pH from 73.9 to neutral range
• Improve drainage through raised beds or subsurface drainage systems
• Avoid field operations when soil is wet to prevent compaction

TECHNICAL NOTES
--------------
• Data extracted from global 250m resolution SoilGrids database
• Analysis focused on topsoil layer (0-5cm depth)
• Values represent spatial averages within the analysis area
• Recommendations are general guidelines - consult local experts for specific advice

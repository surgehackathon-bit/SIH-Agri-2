============================================================

LOCATION INFORMATION
-------------------
City: Kollam
Coordinates: 8.8932°N, 76.6141°E
Analysis Area: 10 km radius around city center
Data Source: SoilGrids 2.0 (ISRIC World Soil Information)

SOIL CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------
Soil pH:
  Value: 53.72 pH units
  Description: pH measured in water solution
  Agricultural Significance: Controls nutrient availability, microbial activity, and crop selection
  Interpretation: Alkaline (pH 53.7) - may need soil amendments

Soil Organic Carbon:
  Value: 391.29 g/kg
  Description: Organic carbon content in soil
  Agricultural Significance: Key indicator of soil health, fertility, and carbon storage
  Interpretation: High organic carbon (39.1%) - excellent soil health

Clay Content:
  Value: 322.71 %
  Description: Proportion of clay particles < 0.002mm
  Agricultural Significance: Affects water retention, nutrient availability, and soil structure
  Interpretation: Clay-dominated soil (323%) - high fertility but may have drainage issues

Sand Content:
  Value: 353.01 %
  Description: Proportion of sand particles 0.05-2mm
  Agricultural Significance: Affects drainage, aeration, and soil workability
  Interpretation: Value: 353.01 %

Silt Content:
  Value: 324.28 %
  Description: Proportion of silt particles 0.002-0.05mm
  Agricultural Significance: Influences water retention and provides balanced soil properties
  Interpretation: Value: 324.28 %

Cation Exchange Capacity:
  Value: 190.54 cmol(c)/kg
  Description: Soil nutrient holding capacity
  Agricultural Significance: Higher values indicate better nutrient retention and soil fertility
  Interpretation: High nutrient holding capacity (190.5 cmol/kg) - excellent for agriculture

Bulk Density:
  Value: 120.12 kg/dm³
  Description: Bulk density of fine earth fraction
  Agricultural Significance: Indicates soil compaction, affects water infiltration and root growth
  Interpretation: Value: 120.12 kg/dm³


AGRICULTURAL ASSESSMENT
----------------------
Highly Suitable Crops:
  • Sugarcane
  • Rice

Soil Limitations:
  • Alkaline soil may cause nutrient deficiencies
  • Heavy clay soil - drainage may be poor

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------
• Add sulfur or organic acids to lower pH from 53.7 to neutral range
• Improve drainage through raised beds or subsurface drainage systems
• Avoid field operations when soil is wet to prevent compaction

TECHNICAL NOTES
--------------
• Data extracted from global 250m resolution SoilGrids database
• Analysis focused on topsoil layer (0-5cm depth)
• Values represent spatial averages within the analysis area
• Recommendations are general guidelines - consult local experts for specific advice
